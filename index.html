- Video needs to be muted, since Chrome 66+ will not autoplay video with sound.
WCAG general accessibility recommendation is that media such as background video play through only once. Loop turned on for the purposes of illustration; if removed, the end of the video will fade in the same way created by pressing the "Pause" button  -->
